// === Why is returning a trait instead of a concrete type useful? ===
// In the context of closures and iterators (more on this in Chapter 13)
// they create types that only the compiler knows or types that are very long to specify
// So `impl Trait` syntax allows you to specify that a function returns some
// type that implements the `Iterator` trait without needing to write out a very long type

// However the `impl Trait` syntax can only be used if you're returning a single type
// So a function that returns either a `NewsArticle` or a `SocialPost` with
// the return type specified as `impl Summary` wouldn't work
